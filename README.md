Excited to share my recent project — Hospital Management System developed using Python.

This project simulates basic hospital operations and helped me strengthen my understanding of structured programming, data handling, and backend logic development.

Key Features:
• Patient registration and record management
• Appointment and data handling
• Search and removal functionality
• Modular menu-driven implementation

Technologies Used:
Python

Working on practical projects like this helps me continuously grow in software development and cybersecurity. I welcome feedback and suggestions!
